# DNDAI: AI-Assisted D&D Master Control Program (MCP)

Welcome to DNDAI, an ambitious project to create a next-generation, AI-assisted Master Control Program (MCP) for immersive tabletop role-playing games like Dungeons & Dragons.

## Project Overview
DNDAI aims to blend the creativity of human Dungeon Masters with the power of modern AI, providing tools for on-the-fly NPC dialogue, rules lookups, encounter ideas, and much moreâ€”all while keeping the DM in control. The system is modular, extensible, and designed for both in-person and remote play.

## Key Features
- **Foundry VTT Integration:** Custom modules for seamless AI, TTS, and advanced features.
- **Multi-LLM Support:** Unified interface for GPT, Claude, PaLM, and more.
- **Text-to-Speech (TTS) & Voice Modulation:** High-quality, expressive NPC and narration voices.
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):** Smart rules and lore lookups using vector databases.
- **DM Approval Workflow:** Co-DM interface for reviewing, editing, or approving AI suggestions.
- **Speaker Tracking:** Real-time speech recognition and diarization for immersive, personalized play.
- **Undo/Rewind System:** Event log and timeline for easy retcons and corrections.
- **Optional Enhancements:** Lighting (Hue/WLED), AI art, soundboard integration, and more.
