# Contributing to DNDAI

Thank you for your interest in contributing to DNDAI! We welcome contributions of all kinds—code, documentation, bug reports, feature requests, and more.

## Getting Started
- Please read the [README.md](./README.md) for an overview of the project, setup instructions, and usage.
- Check open [issues](https://github.com/your-repo/issues) or open a new one to discuss your idea before starting major work.

## Code Style & Standards
- Follow the existing code style (Python: PEP8, JS: Prettier/ESLint recommended).
- Write clear, maintainable, and well-documented code.
- Add or update docstrings and comments as needed.

## Commit Messages
- Use **atomic commits**: each commit should represent a single logical change.
- Write descriptive commit messages (e.g., `feat(tts): add batch playback queue` or `fix: strip tags before TTS`).
- Use imperative mood in the subject line (e.g., "Add feature" not "Added feature").

## Branching & Pull Requests
- Create a new branch for each feature or bugfix (e.g., `feature/tts-batch`, `fix/rag-endpoint`).
- Base your branch on `main` unless otherwise specified.
- Open a pull request (PR) when your work is ready for review.
- Reference related issues in your PR description (e.g., `Closes #42`).
- Ensure your code passes all tests and CI checks before requesting review.
- Be open to feedback and code review—collaboration makes the project better!

## Issue Reporting
- Use [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/your-repo/issues) to report bugs, request features, or ask questions.
- Include clear steps to reproduce, expected vs. actual behavior, and relevant logs or screenshots.
